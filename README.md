## 📊 Day 1: Sales Analysis Dashboard – Awesome Chocolates 🍫

**Description:**  
For Day 1, I designed a **Sales Analysis Dashboard** for a fictional company called *Awesome Chocolates*. The dashboard tracks:
- **Total Sales, Costs, Boxes, and Shipments**
- **Profit & LBS Percentages**
- **Salesperson-wise performance with profit targets**
- **Monthly cost analysis**
- **Shipment distribution**

This project helped me practice:

- Interactive KPIs and visuals
- Clean, user-friendly layouts
- Visual storytelling with Power BI
